 As an admin user
  I want to be able to log into the GreenGiants system
  So that I can access my account and use the system

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid login credentials e.g. aidan@test.com
    And I click the Submit button
    Then I should be logged in to my account

  Scenario: Invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid login credentials
    And I click the Submit button
    Then I should see an error message indicating that my login was unsuccessful

  Scenario: Empty credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I leave the username and/or password fields blank
    And I click the Submit button
    Then I should see an error message indicating that the fields cannot be left blank

  Scenario: Forgotten password
    Given I am on the login page
    When I click the "forgot password" link
    Then I should be directed to the password reset page

  Scenario: Create new account
    Given I am on the login page
    When I click the "create new account" link
    Then I should be directed to the account registration page
